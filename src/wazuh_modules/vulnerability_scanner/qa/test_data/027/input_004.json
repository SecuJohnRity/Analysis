    "description": "This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat\nis a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with\nthe parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the\nparser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A\nstart tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may\nregister handlers.",
